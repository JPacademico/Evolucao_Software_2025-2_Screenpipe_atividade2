 1. **Release Strategy**: Screenpipe appears to follow a Semantic Versioning (SemVer) strategy, as indicated by the format of the release tags (major.minor.patch). This strategy allows for clear communication about the nature of changes in each release, with major releases indicating backward-incompatible changes, minor releases indicating new features or improvements, and patch releases indicating bug fixes.

2. **Workflow Model**: Based on the commit messages and the structure of the repository, it seems that Screenpipe is using a GitHub Flow or GitFlow-like workflow. This workflow involves developing features on feature branches, creating pull requests for code review, merging approved pull requests into a `develop` branch, and then periodically merging the `develop` branch into the `master` branch to create a new release.

In more detail:

- Developers create feature branches from the `develop` branch to work on new features or bug fixes.
- Once the work is complete, developers create a pull request to merge their changes into the `develop` branch.
- Other developers review the pull request and provide feedback or approve the changes.
- Once the pull request is approved, it is merged into the `develop` branch.
- Periodically, the `develop` branch is merged into the `master` branch, and a new release is created and tagged with a SemVer-compliant version number.

This workflow allows for a clear separation of development and release branches, facilitating collaboration and ensuring a stable `master` branch for production releases.
